## Project Description
This assignment is a prototype of song recommender based on the spotify features of a song. The code asks you to enter a song, gets its features, it assigns those features to a cluster of out database and returns one random song of that same cluster.

## Dataset
The dataset upon the clustering is done is a Spotify playlist that contains nearly 10,000 songs. 

## Workflow
The workflow has been the following:
1. Get to know the Spotify API (Spotipy)
2. Build a function to get the features of a song
3. Build the database
4. Create the clusters
5. Put in the same cell input and the big database
6. Testing
7. Presentation
